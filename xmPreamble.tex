% This is a rather very advanced example of using TeX-functionality
%  First-time users should just skip reading this.
%  When using this xmPreamble for your own repo,
%  remove this section, UNLESS YOU WANT pre-2025-OSU versions of hints and expandables
%  If so, KEEP ONLY the two lines with \def\xmNot....
%
%  With this code fragment, one gets BY DEFAULT OSU-style hints.
%  UNLESS the filename contains the string 'Variant', 
%         when one gets the newer expandable hints. 
%  Once the OSU server gets updated, all this will become obsolete.
\IfSubStr{\jobname}{\detokenize{Variant}}{
    \typeout{Compiling NEW version for \jobname\ (with hint as expandable)}%
}{
    \typeout{Compiling OSU version of hints for \jobname}%
    % These variables give the OLD types of hints.
    % In the (near) future, this should no longer be needed.
    %  Only for use with OSU server, and xake > v2.1.3
